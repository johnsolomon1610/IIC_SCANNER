# IIC_SCANNER

IIC Scanner is a **QR Code Based Stuent Attendance App**. This Application is a combination  of  two  android applications (QR Generator and Scanner) developed for taking and storing the attendance 
of the students on the daily basis in the college. Here the professor, who is handling the subjects, will be responsible to mark the attendance of the students. 
Each staff will be given an android application that is used for taking attendance and generate the overall attendance status. An accurate report based on the student
attendance  is  generated  here.  Report  of  the  studentâ€™s  attendance  on  weekly  and monthly basis is generated as desired.
